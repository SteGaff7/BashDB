README:

This is the read me file for my database management system.
The zipped folder (project12309511) should contain, the README, a pdf report and 8 scripts 
(create_database, create_table, insert, select, client, server, P, V).

Download all scripts and run in terminal.

1.) Run the server.sh with no arguments in one terminal.
2.) Run the client.sh with an ID(s) of your choice or "admin" in one or multiple terminals.
3.) The client will now be prompted to enter their request.
4.) Valid requests:
	- create_database database_name
	- create_table database_name table_name header_columns(seperated by commas)
	- insert database_name table_name column_entries(seperated by commas)
	- select database_name table_name
	- select database_name table_name queried_columns
	- select database_name table_name queried_columns column where_value (where
	  clause)
	- exit
	- shutdown (admin use only)

5.) The client script should be exited using request "exit" however ctrl_c and ctrl_z
will also exit and cleanup sufficiently. 
6.) The server script can be kept running however it should be stopped before the 
terminal is closed so that the appropraite cleanup is carried out, this can be achieved 
by running request "shutdown" as client admin or using ctrl_c or ctrl_z.

Notes on requests & parameter entries:

Only the admin may run the request shutdown which shuts the server and logs off clients.
Any entry that requires columns separated by commas cannot have spaces between words
and the commas. 
For the select query, specified columns must be in order eg. 1,2,4, not 2,4,1 this 
will ensure correct error handling is carried out.
For the "bonus" select where clause query, the paramters are the same as the select query 
with the addition of the column number of the where value and this value. For instance:
select database table 1,2,4 2 Murphy --> return columns 1,2,4 where column 2 = 'Murphy'.
